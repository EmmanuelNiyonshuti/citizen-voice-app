## Future Improvements
This project was developed in a short timeframe during a hackathon, and there's plenty of room for enhancements, including:

1. Multi-language support for wider accessibility

2. Location tagging using maps to pinpoint issue locations

3. Email/SMS notifications for ticket updates

4. Analytics dashboard for insights on recurring issues
